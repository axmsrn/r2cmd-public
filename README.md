_Dual-pane interface with local file system and SSH remote server_

**About the name.** R2Cmd originally started as a specialized file manager for [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/r2/) object storage. As the project grew, it evolved into a general-purpose dual-pane file manager with SSH, local filesystem, and archive support — but the name stuck. The "Cmd" suffix honors the classic commander-style file managers (Norton Commander, Midnight Commander) that inspired its keyboard-first design.
